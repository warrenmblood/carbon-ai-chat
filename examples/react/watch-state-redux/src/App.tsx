/**
 * Example: Carbon AI Chat — Watch state with Redux Toolkit
 *
 * Demonstrates: bridging `BusEventType.STATE_CHANGE` into a Redux Toolkit
 * store so any component can read mirrored chat state via `useSelector`.
 * The chat owns its state; this example mirrors it one-way into Redux.
 * `instance.getState()` seeds the store; the bus subscription keeps it in
 * sync. The Redux-backed status panel is the primary host surface — the
 * chat sits in the corner as a launcher so opening it produces observable
 * transitions in the panel.
 *
 * APIs exercised:
 *   - `ChatContainer`
 *   - `BusEventType.STATE_CHANGE`
 *   - `instance.getState()` for the initial Redux seed
 *   - `Provider` (`react-redux`) and the typed `useSelector` (see `store.ts`)
 *
 * Start reading at: `App()`, then the `onBeforeRender` bridge.

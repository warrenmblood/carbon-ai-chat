/**
 * Tile fixtures for the input-custom-render example.
 *
 * Demonstrates: the shape of the host-page data that backs both the clickable
 * tile grid and the custom `tileChip` Tiptap node injected into the chat
 * input. `value` is what the editor serializes as text (so the send button
 * enables); `id` / `label` / `value` ride along in structured data.
 *
 * APIs exercised:
 *   - (plain data) — no `@carbon/ai-chat` API
 *
 * Start reading at: the `tiles` export.

/**
 * Example: Carbon AI Chat — Custom element (lazy load)
 *
 * Demonstrates: code-splitting `ChatCustomElement` with `React.lazy` and
 * using `<cds-aichat-shell>` (via the `ChatShell` React wrapper) as a
 * crossfade fallback covering both the bundle download and the chat's
 * own initialization. The example purposely adds a 3-second delay so the
 * crossfade is visible.
 *
 * APIs exercised:
 *   - `React.lazy` + `Suspense` to defer the chat bundle
 *   - `ChatShell` (overlay shown during bundle + init)
 *   - `PublicConfig.launcher.isOn` + `header.hideMinimizeButton`
 *     (load-skeleton-crossfade-specific variances)
 *
 * Start reading at: `LazyChatCustomElement` below and `App()`.
